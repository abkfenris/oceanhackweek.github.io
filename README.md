## Archived sites and pages from previous years

### OHW 2020

Currently the materials from 2019 are archived in a GitHub branch, https://github.com/oceanhackweek/oceanhackweek.github.io/tree/ohw20archive. Though the individual markdown pages are accessible, the site is not currently viewable directly as a web site proper. This repo hosts pages accessible from the upper-right drop-down menu; these are found in the `_pages` directory. The content for the main, "front" page is found on the Jekyll sub-module repo https://github.com/oceanhackweek/jekyll-spectral-theme, in the `_includes` directory.
