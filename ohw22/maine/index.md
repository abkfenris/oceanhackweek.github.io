# US East

This year we are having two parallel East Coast events in Maine.
One event will be held at Bigelow Labs in Boothbay, and the other at Gulf of Maine Research Institute in Portland
​
## Location
​
Gulf of Maine Research Institute, Portland, ME and/or Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences, East Boothbay, ME
​
## Format: In-person
​
We have reserved rooms at each location to watch the tutorials and work on projects. There is no travel, lodging or meal support provided.
​

Once participants have been selected we will reach out to see which location people would prefer to be at.

## Applicants profile: Local participants (within commuting distance)​

We welcome participants from all career stages and encourage applications from graduate students, postdocs and early career researchers. Advanced undergrad students with background in oceanography and data science are also welcome.

## Summary
​
1. We will watch all the tutorials
2. Participants can asynchronously work on projects with participants of other OHW events (either the global virtual event or other satellites). Or participants can work on projects synchronously with other local participants.
3. We will encourage students to communicate with the global virtual event and other satellite events to augment their OHW experience.
