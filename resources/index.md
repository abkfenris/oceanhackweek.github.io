# OHW22 Resources

:::{admonition} Updates in progress
:class: warning

The resources are actively being updated! Some parts are still out of date, and is the content from last year. In the meantime, please watch out for references to 2021 ("OHW21") or links that don't work.

:::

To make sure that OHW22 will be a welcoming environment for everyone, please read our [Code of Conduct](/about/code-of-conduct.md) carefully as part of your preparation. We expect all participants to adhere to the Code of Conduct in all interactions throughout the hackweek.

## Schedules

There are a few different schedules and participants may need to pay attention to multiple based on if they are part of the global event, or at a satellite.
Go to [the Schedule page for details](schedule.md).

## Preparation

We will use a [JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub)-based online environment for all OceanHackWeek computational activities, including tutorials; this environment supports both Python and R. You will need a robust internet connection and a capable laptop or desktop computer. 
<!-- **On July 29 and 30, we will offer short "pre-hackweek" optional sessions to answer questions on the basics of Git, GitHub, Jupyter and core R and Python scientific libraries, and OceanHackWeek in general. The schedule is available in the [Schedule page](schedule.md#pre-hackweek-optional-check-ins), and the Zoom link will be sent via Slack.** -->

We will use Slack, Zoom and GitHub as our primary communication and content delivery platforms. The week before OceanHackWeek you will receive via email an invitation to join the OceanHackWeek GitHub organization, [https://github.com/oceanhackweek/](https://github.com/oceanhackweek/) if you have not received it already, along with Slack invites and Zoom connection info.
